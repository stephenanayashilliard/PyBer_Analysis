# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
the following report was created for Pyber,  a ride-sharing app company valued at aproximately $2.3 billion dollars.

### Purpose
Using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, we were tasked to create multiple graphs and charts illustrating the following:
- Total Rides per Area Type
- Total Drivers per Area Type
- Total Fares per Area Type
- Average Fare per Rider per Area Type
- Average Fare per Driver per Area Type
- Total Fares by City Type

In addition a written report summarizing the data as well as written recomendations for future business developement was requested.
All data is based on data recieved between January 2019 and late April 2019.  Driving areas were broken down into 3 categories: Rural, Suburban, and urban areas.

### Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software:
 - Python 3.6.1
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
